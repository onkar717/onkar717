ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Onkar, a second-year student passionate about web development and the MERN stack.
ðŸ’» Currently, I'm passionately refining my craft in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
But wait, there's more magic brewing! I'm also delving into the enchanting world of Data Structures and Algorithms, mastering the dance of code in Java.
ðŸš€ Excited to collaborate on projects and contribute to the open-source community. 
Let's code together and build something awesome! ðŸŒŸ #CodeLife #MERNstack #OpenSource
